`gatsby --version`
`sanity --version`

## 3 - What is Gatsby?

# Gatsby Basics

## 4 - What is Gatsby?

- Framework for building modern websites
  - Manages data
  - Routing strategy
  - Build process
- _React_ is a library for rendering out data to HTML very quickly
  - Gatsby uses React under the hood
  - Adds on additional stuff for building a modern website
- Examples:
  - wesbos.com
- Advantages
  - Pushes from one page to another
  - We aren't going from page to page
    - Loading different pieces of the website
    - Then updates the URL

### Overview

- Gatsby is a _static site generator_
  - There is a build-step in your website
  - Performs what WordPress does at build time
  - HTML is generated when you build the website
    - This allows the website to load that much faster
- Smart about CSS
  - Figures out what CSS is needed for that page
  - Loads before the content
  - Avoids the flash of "unstyled" content appearance
- "Rehydration"
  - WesBos.com is a React application
  - Gatsby will load HTML onto a page...
    - Then pick it up and turn it into a fully-featured React application
  - This is known as "rehydration" in the browser
- Lazy Loading
  - Dont need to download the image until you are about to see it
  - Compresses images, converts them to a modern format
  - Routing and loading is baked into it
- Plugins
  - Thousands
    - Offline access
    - Code Highighting
- What Gatsby is NOT
  - CMS (WordPress, Sanity, etc.)
  - No backend that you log into and update your content
- Shortcomings (because of static nature)
  - Need to code things in a particular way
  - Example: Dynamic pages (will cover in the course)

#### Performance on LightHouse

- Gives a score on website best practices
- By default, makes you code in a way to create a fast, performant, SEO friendly website

## 5 - Pages in Gatsby

- `node_modules` - Where dependencies are installed
- `public` --> Generated by Gatsby (same as `gatsby clean`)
- `src` --> Where most of Gatsby will live
  - `pages` is the only Gatsby-specific folder
    - Top level pages (About, Order, etc)
  - The others are made up
  - `assets` --> Fonts/images
  - `components` --> Nav, order button, React components
  - `templates` --> Similar to pages, but reusable (e.g. pagination)
  - `utils` --> Smaller functions (e.g., format money)
- `static` --> Files that you want to be served up as HTML
  - TIP: Generally do not put stuffff intno static
  - Dont want to reference or import anything into Gatsby by their static path
  - Everything must go through Gatsby (imported through Gatsby)
    - By importing it, Gatsby knows about your assets and does the cool performance stuff
  - Think twice about using the static folder

### How Pages are Created

- Can be dynamically generated or based on **file system routing**
  - If you go into pages directory and make a new file...
    - That will be the page that shows up when someone visits
    - Need to export a function from the file
    - That will be rendered as a page
- Function must be exported from the file
  - All Gatsby files (except a few) are modules
    - Can export things from them
    - Assumes that the main export is what is rendered when someone visits the page
  - Then need to start the gatsby build
    - Must be in gatsby folder
    - Scripts in `package.json` execute gatsby commands (build, start, clean, etc)
    - `develop` puts us into live reload mode
  - `npm start` runs `gatsby develop`
  - GraphQL - How we are going to source our data (remember for later)
- Renders a 404 page by default

#### 404 Dev Mode

- Will see 404 page when loaded into production

#### Scaffolding

- Creating the bar bones of all pages

## 5 - Routing and Navigation in Gatsby

- _Component:_ Reusable pieces inside of pages
- Instead of using anchor links, we use the link tag
  - Renders an anchor link
  - Loaded with JavaScript needed
- `{ Link }` - Component exported by Gatsby
  - Does HTML Push State
  - There are times when you want to programatically change pages
    - Submit form, click specific button, etc

### Declarative vs Imperative

- Declarative: Use Link
- Imperative: Write code to define what happens as a result of a form submit

## 6 - Creating Reusable Layouts

- Using react components with children components
- Typically wont see props passed as a huge payload
- Props will be destructured in the function
  - Grab children directly from the function
  - Place in a top level variable

### Props Validation

- When you have a component that expects a prop, you assign prop types
- Ensures that the right things are being passed in development
- Other ways to do props (e.g., TypeScript)

### Custom Files

- Gatsby browser + Gatsby SSR Files
- Automaticlly wrap files for us
- Create `gatsby.browser.js` IN THE ROOT FOLDER of `gatsby`
  - Allows us to hook into different Gatsby APIs
  - Wrap page element hook wraps Components for us
  - Avoid having to do this on every single page
- By Default, Gatsby does not wrap your page elements
- **NOTE:** Whenever you modify, you need to quit the build and restart it
  - Kill the process and restart via `npm start`

### React Fragments

- **Ghost Fragments** allow you to return two or more elements
- JSX only allows you to return one element
- Wrap with `<> </>`

### Gatsby-SSR vs Gatsby-Browser

- Browser runs when the page is loaded and generated in the browser
- Gatsby also generates everything on the server so that it renders fast
  - That is what `gatsby-ssr.js` is for
- Can copy/paste everything from `gatsby-browser.js` into `gatsby-ssr.js`

## 8 - Global Styles

- Gatsby needs to know about everything in project
- Data, pages, links, even CSS
- All CSS dumped into HTML is dumped before any of the content
- Gatsby knows what CSS that was written is the _critical CSS_ for that page to render with a flash of unstyled text
- Instead of linking to CSS, we need to import it through Gatsby

### CSS Options

- Import CSS files into gatsby-browser.js
- _We are going to use \*\*Styled Components_\*\*
  - A way to used Scoped CSS within a React application
  - Used to scope CSS and make reusable, styled components

### Styled Components - Steps

1. Set global styles in application

- On any website you will have global styles
  - Background, scroll bar appearance, max-width on images etc.
- Doesnt make sense to reset them every time you make a new component
- **First Step:** Normalize entire application
  - `normalize.css`
  - Normalizes browsers so that you start with the same foundation in each one
  - _This is an npm package that was already installed by Wes_
- Created global styles in _styles_ directory
- Gatsby allows you to import anything, including images and CSS
  - It knows not to render it out to JS, **but** to render out to correct format
  - Not being added to _assets_ folder because:
    - If so, they would have to go in the _static_ folder which Gatsby doesnt know about
- Stick global styles into a variable and export them

#### Loading Images

- Gatsby renders out a base64 string before loading onto the server
  - Gatsby ships the image as text (20px by 20px)
  - You can scale that image up as the larger one is pulled down from the CDN
- Gatsby will take an SVG, compress it and place a random identifier on it
  - Never have to do a hard refresh - literally a different filename than the original image - it will be **cached**

2. Create typography styles
3. Write CSS

## 8 - Typography

- Keep in a separate file
- Create in the `src/styles` folder

## 9 - Styling the Nav and Logo // 10 - Styling our Layout

1. Import styled
2. Define the element you want to style (e.g., .nav)
3. Add styles
4. Replace <nav> tags with the variable name (NavStyles)

### Styles in Nav.js

- Any styles that we put here will not be applied to anywhere else on our website
- Any link inside of the nav element will be red

### Global Style - Inheritance

- Styles written w/o any selector are applied to the mainn element (nav)
- TIP: Make main components a style
  - Use child selectors to grab things inside of them
  - If you need to reuse styles multiple times, you can create a new var

### Nesting components

- If you unencessarily nest, it gets tricky (for media queries etc)

### CSS Variables

- Helpful for when you want to redefine a single CSS attribute on an element
- PROBLEM: For properties like `transform`, other attributes will be overwritten
- SOLUTION: Assign properties with variables
  - For elements that you want to update, you only need to reference the variable

# Module 4: Headless CMS

## 10 - Headless CMS

- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)
- _Headless_ = No frontend
- No way to view the data in your website with Sanity
  - Just the backend
- Front-end is what we are building (Slick Slices)
- That data is pulled in via Gatsby with a Plugin
- Steps are roughly the same as any CMS you use
  - Create data --> Inject into site
- Sanity - Pros:
  - Balance between up and running quickly + done for you
  - Customizable

### File Structure

-

### Configuration

- `sanity init --reconfigure`
  - Prompt you to create a new account
  - To relogin, enter `sanity login`
  - Default dataset is a public DB called "production"
  - can have multiple datasets (for dev environments ex)
- Can delete the `yarn.lock` file if it appears
  - `package-lock.json` is the same thing

### Using Sanity

- `npm start`
  - Fires up a local server that will give us Sanity Studios
  - `Sanity Studios` - UI that we use to configure CRUD operations on data
  - `sanity` - CLI
- `sanity start`

### Sanity.JSON

- `Parts` --> pieces of JS that need to be loaded
  - Only need to touch when doing custom ones
  - Goes to the `schema.js` file

### Schema.js

- File is preloaded
- Take all data types and concatenate them into our schema

### Making Our Own Schema

- Schema file - create new file `pizza.js`
- Exporting an object with data in it
- `name` Computer name
- `title` Visible title

## 12 - Creating the Toppings Content Type and custom previews

- Second data type called `topping`
  - Pizza has many toppings
  - "Based on this topping, show me pizzas with this topping"

### Importing Icons

- Can import Font-Awesome icons, other icons from other librarie
- Just imports that icon, not the entire library

### Merging Fields into the schema

- After creating the `topping.js` file, you need to merge it into `schema.js`

## 13 - Creating Data Relationships

- Need a way to select what toppings to put on the pizza
- Go into the `pizza.js` and create a new object (toppings)

- Anytime you have a websocket and reload the page, Firefox will complain
  - Ignore

### Sanity

- [Reference-Type](https://www.sanity.io/docs/reference-type)

## 14 - Creating our Personn Data Type

### Overview

- Person schema (to create people)
  - Involves pagination
- Settings page
  - Want to be able to specify:
    - Who is "slicing" pizza
    - What pizza is currently by the case

## 15 - Custom CMS Inputs in Sanity

### Overview

- Inputting cents for pizza
- Want to display actual price in the editor
- Good use case for _custom input components_
- We have full control over the code that runs in Sanity

### Challenge

- Put a veggie symbol next to the pizza name if all of the toppings are vegetarian
- Would need to go into the preview, select all toppings, loop through and select the icon if all are vegetarian

### Custom Components

1. Create a folder `components`
1. Create a file `PriceInput.js`
1. Add a boilerplate React component
1. Go into schema `pizza.js` and import `PriceInput.js`

- **NOTE:** Styling does not perfectly match Sanity Studio
  - Sanity Studio adds classes
  - There are docs, but more trouble than its worth
  - _Going to make it easier_

### React Requirement - Adding dynamic values to inputs

- Anytime you put a `value` into an `input`, you must also supply an `onChange` handler
- Within `PriceInput.js`, import a helper function called `PatchEvent, { set, unset } from 'part:@sanity/form-builder/patch-event';`

# Module 5: Getting Data into Gatsby with GraphQL

## 16 - An intro to gatsby-config and sourcing data

### Overview

- How do you take the data that lives in Sanity and get it into Gatsby?
  - Use the **GraphQL PlayGround**
  - _http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql_
- Allows you to see "GraphQL Queries"
  - Can run queries in there and see what it returns
  - Use to write queries

### Connection to Gatsby

- When we build (before deploying to internet), Gatsby collects all the data it needs to run
- Gatsby will go to sanity -- all data, relationships, images, etc. -- and will stick it into a temporary database -- it's memory
- Gatsby then allows us to query that data with GraphQL queries
- GraphQL provides queries that come standard with Gatsby
  - allSite, allFile, directory, etc.
  - _This is not helpful for devs - more for lower-level authors_
- _Question:_ How do we surface our data from Sanity and surface it in the GraphQL explorer?
  - **Answer:** Plugins
  - These are defined in `Gatsby-config.js`
  - Used to specify plugins for your website
  - Can also specify metadata, URls, titles etc.
  - Have lesser-used ones (path-prefix) (eg wesbos.com/blog)

### Creating the File

- Will add metadata to show how to add it + how it is sourced to GraphQL explorer
- Will also add plugins
- Create file in root of `gatsby` folder caleld `gatsby-config.js`
- [Gatsby Config API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/)
-

## 17 - Sourcing Sanity ata and GraphQL Introduction

### Overview

- Plugins make it easy to work with other packages and libraries
- To specify plugins, do so via a _plugins array_ that live in `gatsby-config.js`
- Ways to use a plugin:
  1. Specify name of the plugin; accept all default options
  2. Styled component plugin that surfaces the CSS to Gatsby
  - Gatsby can then figure out the critical CSS
  3. If there are settings that need to be set, you pass in an object and add a `resolve` object to the plugin that you are adding
- **NOTE:** To add your own plugins, `npm install gatsby-plugin-styled-components` etc or whatever you want

### Storing Sensitive Data

- Save in a `.env` file
- Import the `dotenv` package
- By default, Sanity will surface tokens starting with GATSBY\_
- To access ENV vars in Gatsby-config, you need to use `dotenv.config({ path: '.env' });`

### Deploying a GraphQL API for Sanity

- By default, Sanity has a 'grok' API
- For GraphQL (built with Grok), you need to enable that
- [Docs for Sanity GraphQL](https://www.sanity.io/docs/graphql)
- Command: `sanity graphql deploy production`
  - **NOTE:** Production is the name of the dataset

### Moving data from Sanity API to Gatsby API

- Sanity API is
- Not working with it directly
- Want to move it from Sanity API to Gatsby API
- **Solution:** Restart Gatsby server with Ctrl + C // npm start

### GraphQL - Querying Data

- Can query as much data as you want
- If you query all pizzas, you can also query allSanityPerson in the same query
- There is only one endpoint, and you can grab all of the data that you want
  query MyQuery {
  allSanityPizza {
  nodes {
  name
  price
  slug {
  current
  }
  }
  }
  allSanityPerson {
  nodes {
  name
  }
  }
  }
- Can select individual pizzas (grab the ID)

## 18 - Learning Gatsby Queries

### Page Queries

- Can be dynamic with variables
- Can only be run on a top level page
- To specify, export a query from the page
  - Gatsby will identify that as a query and fetch the data during the build
  - It will then pass that data to the page component

### Static Queries

- Can not be dynamic, no variables can be passed in
- Can be run anywhere

### Example - Pizzas Page

- On pizzas page
- We want to query all of the pizzas that have a toppinng, OR - if there is no topping specified, we will query all of the pizzas
- **NOTE:** If you want to have variables in your query, it has to happen at a page level
  - Slight limitation of Gatsby

### CONSOLE TIP - \$r

- If you select a React component and then go to your Console and enter `$r`...
- ... It will return the React component as an object
- _This is helpful for digging into the props of a component_

# Module 6: Puttin in Work

## 19 - Gatsby Images

- Images make your website very slow
- The steps needed to make your site fast are often too hard for regular web devs
- Gatsby makes the progressive loading, resizing, and compression of your images much faster

### What is Wrong with images on internet?

- Too big
- Not compressed (file size might be the right size, but it could be 50% smaller w/ an algo)
  - "Lossless" [no sacrifice on quality] vs "Lossy" compression
- Width / Height --> You want to resize to a perfect square but maybe dont have the right tools
- Poor loading performance. Can load in, but as it downloads you can see nothing
- Not the right format. Lots of different formats (PNG, JPG, WebP)

### Solution

- Tell Gatsby the info that you want to know
- It will deliver to you a _Gatsby image_
  - Has all of the info that you need
- Takes care of ratios (can be hard in CSS)
- Gives a `data-image` --> image shown while the actual image is loading
  - _(Images are blurry for a moment while the full version is downloaded)_
- `<picture>` element - tries to serve you a WebP version, otherwise it will serve a JPEG
  - Will serve multiple versions of the image depending on the size of the actual image

### Using Gatsby Image

- You need something to process those images
- As a dev, you can add a JPEG into Gatsby, but shouldnt load it onto the website
- You need either:
  - A service
  - A compute
- ... That will manually process the images, make versions of them (small/large, JPEG/WebP etc.)
- To process images, there are two ways:
  1. Source your images
  - If you have images in a directory
    - Similar to Sanity
  - Pipe them through **Gatsby Sharp**
    - Runs on your computer or Netlify build
    - This can take a long time
    - Ex: Fresh build for Wes can take up to 20 min (has ~300 images)
    - Image processing is very expensive (takes a lot of compute)
  2. Use Gatsby image, but with a service
  - You can upload images directly or feed your image
  - Images will be produced as the customer requests them
  - **_Sanity_** has an **image pipeline** -- what we will be using
    - Compatible with Gatsby Image
  - **_Cloudinary_**
  - **_Imgix_**
  - **NOTE:** Gatsby image works the same way regardless of your service

### Putting Images Together

- We can use a custom image element that ships with Gatsby
- Then feed all props.image data to Gatsby

### Types of Images

- Fixed: Fixed width/height
- _Fluid_: Responsive. Can resize the image (_suggested_)
- _Gatsby will only load images on demand as you scroll them into view_
  - Means you aren't using unecessary bandwidth - both on your server and the customer

### Getting a Different Sized Image

- Go to page `pizza.js` (where we are querying the data)
- In the GraphQL query, we can:
  - Simply update the GraphQL query
    fixed(width: 200, height: 200) {
    ...GatsbySanityImageFixed
    }
- You can then pass these to an `<Img fixed={pizza.image.asset.fixed}>`

### Funky Image Dimensions

- Sanity will chop the images for you
  - Suppose you wanted a height of 200 & width of 600 (very wide)
  - _There is also functionality to ensure that the images aren't chopped in a poor way_

## 20 - Loading in Sample Data

- Sanity --> Sample Data -->
  - `all-sample-data.gz`: All pizza toppings, slicemasters etc
- In sanity root, run `sanity dataset import ./sample-data/all-sample-data.gz production --replace`
  - `--replace` --> overwrite
- If you go to `localhost:3333`, all of the data is immediatelly loaded into Sanity

## 21 - Styling our Pizza Grid with CSS

### Overivew

- Open up `PizzaList.js`
- We are going to create a styled component called `PizzaGridStyles`

### CSS Grid

### CSS SubGrid

## 22 - Static Queries and Building the Toppings Filter

### Overview

- Want to create a filter that will:
  - List all of the toppings
  - Pizza that has that topping
  - Click on each one and filter for pizzas that have that topping

### Steps

- Creating a new component called `ToppingsFilter.js`

# Module 7 - Making Gatsby Dynamic

## 23 - Dynamically creating pages with gatsby-node

- Creating dynamic pages with `gatsby-node.js`
  - API for controlling your sites data in the GraphQL layer
  - Do things at various points during the Gatsby build cycle
- `graphql` --> GraphQL queries
- `actions` --> used for creating pages

### Steps

- Store in folder `templates`
- Create file `Pizza.js`
  - Because it is reused multiple times, it is a Class and should be capitalized
- We need _just enough_ data in the `await graphql('');` statement to:
  - Render out the template
  - The template itself will go off and fetch the data

### Inspecting Pizza Pages

- In React Dev tools, there is a prop `pageContext`
- If you need to pass data from .createPage method to the template, that can be done with `context`
  - Displays as `pageContext` within props

### Updating Pizza.JS

- Can use graphql as if it were a standard page
- Interpolate variables into query
  - Variables are passed into graphql query as arguments
  - Here we are passing the `slug` that is specified in the context of `actions.createPage()` in `gatsby-node.js`
- Then, when using graphql on `Pizza.js` page, the outputs will be for the \$slug variabe from `gatsby-node.js`

### Alternative

- Query the entire pizza in gatsby-node.js
- Then pass the entire pizza as context
- You can then skip the graphql query in Pizza.js
  - That is **valid**
- **TIP:** Prefers to keep actual query in page itself
- Avoids having to jump back into Gatsby-node.js
- PLUS -- you would have to kill the process each time. Allows for faster iterating

### Beefing Out query

- We want name, id, image (asset, etc),

## 24 - Templating and Styling our Single Pizza Page

### Go into Pizza.js

- Now rendering out the page
- Imports:
  - React
  - graphql
  - Img from 'gatsby-image' (**NOTE:** Not called Img so auto import will not work)
  -

## 25 - Dynamically Creating Toppings Pages

### Overview

- We are going to reuse pizza.js age, but pass it the ability to insert for a specific topping
- Ex --> Click on roasted garlic --> should see the pizzas that have roasted garlic

### DIFFERENCE

- We already have a page that shows what pizzas have what toppings - `pages/pizza.js`
- Modify the PizzaQuery to take in an argument for what topping to filter for

### Filtering for Toppings

- Add a filter for toppings in GraphQL
- Filters are never standard across GraphQL implementations
  - **We are seeing the way that Gatsby does it**
- Use a regex expression `elemMatch` on the name of each topping
- The query on the `pizza.js` page also takes in an **argument**
  - This arg comes from the `toppings` query in gatsby-node.js
  - _(Same concept as the Pizza query)_
- The original query is simply enriched with a filter

### Highlighting the Current Topping

- Go to `ToppingsFilter` and pass it the `activeTopping`
  - Can destructure `pageContext` in the `PizzasPage` component
- Then, in `ToppingsFilter.js`, we can then destructure that value `activeTopping`
  - Display output to see that it is working

## 26 - Sourcing Data from an external API

### Overview

- Probable that your website has data that must be pulled in from an API
- Ex -- REST API (Tweets, posts, GitHub etc) that you need to pull in?
- Still want to reap all the benefits of server-rendered, pre-rendered, SEO-friendly etc.
- `https://sampleapis.com/beers`
  - We are going to be fetching this at build time
- How do we get this data into our Gatsby GraphQL API, query, and pull it in?
  - **ANSWER:** Gatsby-node.js
  - We are already hooking into the `createPages` API
  - There is _also_ an API for _Sourcing Nodes_
    - **SOURCING:** Putting the data into your Gatsby API
    - **NODE:** Piece of data
      - When we do our pizza query, we ask for the nodes (each piece of data is a node)
    - We want to put data into the GraphQL API by **Sourcing** them

### Steps

- Add an additional `export async function fetchBeersAndTurnIntoNodes` as well as `export async function sourceNodes` in `gatsby-node.js`
  - Await the output of `fetchBeers` within the `sourceNodes` hook. Wrap with `Promise.all()`
- **NOTE:** Remember to pass the `params` down into the `beers` funnction from `sourceNodes`
- _Con of Gatsby:_ Feedback cycle for `gatsby-node.js` is slow (at the moment)

### Thoughts

- Difference between writing a plugin for Gatsby and writing it in your gatsby-node.js is nothing
- If you were to open the sanity-source plugin, they are doing the same thing
  - Grabbing some data, looping over data, then putting it into your GraphQL API for you
- Next: queries to pull data into your beers page
  - **Challenge:** Write queries to pull this into our beers page
    - Query all the beers and display them (if they have a photo or not, rating, etc)

## 27 - Querying, Displaying and Stlying the Beers Page

# Module 8 - Pages & Filterirng

## 28 - Querying and Displaying Pagination

### Overview

- Query data
- Loop over data
- Modify data in next module for pagination

## 29 - Paginating Data in Gatsby

### Overview

- Instead of having everything on one page, add next/prev page content
- When doing pagination, need to know the total number of people
  - For this we can query the `totalCount`
- Not going to be querying every person all at once
  - Therefore, wont know unless asking GraphQL for the info
- We need to store the number of people to go on each page
- Usually pagination is done on demand
  - Because Gatsby is pre-generated at build time, we need to know at build time how many pages there are
  - We will go into `gatsby-node.js` and do things like:

### Steps

- Set environment variables in **.env** file
  - _(Can also go in a settings.js file)_
- **NOTE:** For variables to show up in Gatsby, they must be prefixed with `GATSBY_`
  - Other variables will not be surfaced (e.g., _SANITY_TOKEN_)
  - `<p>{process.env.GATSBY_PAGE_SIZE}</p>`
    - The value gets pulled in from your _.env_ file
- **TIP**: Gatsby is currently testing a new hot reloader w/ the var `GATSBY_HOT_LOADER=fast-refresh`
- Go into `gatsby-node.js`; create a new function to turn the Slicemasters into pages

### TIP - Looping through index

- `Array.from({ length: 5}).forEach((_, i) => console.log(i));`

## 30 - Filtering the data based on Pagination

### Overview

- query on slicemasters will take the incoming content from `gatsby-node.js` and modify the # of people on the page

## 31 - Creating a reusable Pagination Component

### Overview

- General use pagination
- ## Make a new file in components `pagination.js`

# Module 9 - Custom Pages + SEO

## 32 - Single Slicemaster Pages

## 33 - Gatsby SEO and Head Tags

### Overview

- Highest level we get is the `Layout.js`

  - There are no HTML, body, etc tags - all gets added by Gatsby
  - **Question:** How do you stick things into the <head>?

- **SOLUTION:** `React Helmet`

  - Known as a _side effect_ - JS takes the component and update it outside of itself
  - You can take the GraphQL results and load them into the head element

  - Allows us to stick tags into React helmet
  - Will transport them out from wherever you put them into the document's head
  - Useful for HTLM attributes, SEO, OpenGraph meta tags, etc.

- Example: `pizza.js`
  - `import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';`
  - You can stick a helmet wherever you want in your component and then just start putting tags into it

### Tip - Reusable SEO

- TIP: Create a reusable SEO component that has a set of default
- Remove Helmet from `Pizza.js`
- Go into `gatsby-config.js`
  - We are going to us a gatsby plugin
  - \*When we get into server rendering / pre-building, there is a plugin needed for server-rendered, which is very important for seo
  - Add `'gatsby-plugin-react-helmet',` to list of plugins
- Go into `components` folder, create `SEO.js`

### More on React Helmet

- You can see which attributes were added by React Helmet bc they will have `data-react-helmet` attributes on them
- After creating the SEO base, we need to go through every single page (everything that lives in pages as well as templates) and add the SEO

# Module 10 - Order Form, Custom Hooks and state management

## 34 - Creating the order page with Custom Hooks

### Overview

- list all the pizzas we have
- Can add pizzas to the order
- Add name, email
- Provide total
- This is a regular form in React
- When someone submits, we take this data and sends it off to an email
- To do this, we need a backend -- going to use **serverless functions**

### Steps

- Adding to `order.js`
- Loop through menu; loop over everything an
  - Can use a **page Query** (on a page) or a **Static query** (no specific variable)

## 35 - Styling our Order Form

### Overview

- Going to keep styles in a separate file
- In styles, create `OrderStyles.js`
  - This is for the fieldsets **menu** and **order**
- Also want to style the individual pizzas
  - Create another page in **Styles** called `MenuItemStyles.js`

## 36 - Custom Hook for our Order Form

### Overview

- When someone clicks one of the buttons, we want to add that to our order
- Going to create a custom hook with custom state to manage
- Creating `usePizza.js` in utils
- In **components**, we are going to make a new component that holds the displaying of order items
  - File `PizzaOrder.js`

## 37 - Calculating our Order Total

# Module 11 - Serverless Functions

## 38 - Moving our Order State to React Context with a Custom Provider

### Overview

- The state we are saving this in exists in our order page
- When we navigate away, Gatsby will unmount and remount the components - thus any state is lost
- To _maintain_ state across page changes, you need to put that state at the highest level in Gatsby so that it doesn't unmount and remount

### Gatsby-browser.js

- There is a hook called `wrapRootElement` that allows us to wrap the actual Gatsby Root
- In React dev tools, can see the **Root** element
  - Only element on the page that stays there
  - All other elements mount and remount when you switch pages
  - Wrapping around the root element allow us to persist that data
- How to do that:
  - We are currently sticking state into a hook at an order level. Need to do it at a root level
  - Will stick all of the data into **context**
    - Allows us to store data at a **high level** and access it at a **lower level** w/o using props
  - Create a new filed called `components/OrderContext.js`
  - In `gatsby-browser.js`, export a function `wrapRootElement`
  - Once added to `gatsby-browser.js`, the **wrapRootElement** must also be added to `gatsby-ssr.js`
- Now, how do we access that state at a **deeper** level?
  - Go to `usePizza.js` hook
  - Calling the function `useContext(OrderContext)`, which takes in **OrderContext** as an argument

### Refreshing the Page

- Data **will** disappear on a page refresh
- Can stick into localStorage and pull it back in when it mounts

### Creating Unique Keys

- Need a unique key since there can be identical pizzas
- Use the index

## 39 - An Intro To Serverless Functions

### Overview

- When you build Gatsby, it uses HTMl, CSS, and JS to handle custom functionality
- Doing things on the backend is challenging
  - Sanity handles the backend
  - What about sending email? Needs to happen on the server-side
- Gatsby works well with serverless functions (Lambda)
  - Similar to running a Node server, except it runs only for the duration of code execution
  - Going to be using Netlify functions (hosts serverless functions)
  - Can host wherever you want

### Steps

- Make a new folder `functions`
- Make a new file `netlify.toml` in the **root** of your directory
  - Need to tell Netlify where your serverless functions live
- Inspect `package.json`

  - We have been running `npm start`, which runs `npm develop` which then runs `gatsby develop`
  - We now need to run `npm run netlify` which will run `netlify dev`
    - Both will run `npm run start` under the hook and set itself up properly for running serverless functions

- Kill the gatsby build

  - Run `npm run netlify`
  - Will provide a URL where we can run the website off of (localhost:8888)
  - Netlfy dev will proxy gatsby for us
  - **PROBLEM:** --> Ran into an error when attempting to run `npm run netlify`:
    - _Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/kevingrimm\_/Desktop/LEARN_JAVASCRIPT/GATSBY/master-gatsby/starter-files/gatsby/node_modules/netlify-redirector/lib/redirects.wasm'_
    - Googled around / tried different options but didn't have any luck with the command.
    - **SOLUTION:** Follow steps in this [Blog Post](https://joshwcomeau.com/gatsby/using-netlify-functions-with-gatsby/) and execute `netlify dev`

- Make the first serverless function
  - For each function we have, we want to create a new folder
  - Inside of that, create a .js folder that is the **same name** as the folder that it is in
  - Here we code the handler
- To visit the URL:
  1. Go to **http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello**

### What We Are Doing

- Creating a function placeorder with **nodemailer** to connect to an external email service
- Create a new folder and file `placeOrder`
- **NOTE:** Sometimes your serverless functions are so large that you want to have your own package.json for your serverless
  - Go into the folder `placeOrder`
  - Netlify facilitates this with `npm init` to create a **package.json** (press _Enter_ through options)
  - Then, execute `npm i nodemailer` --> allows us to send email w/ JS
- Now flesh out `placeOrder.js` function

### Configuring Ethereal.email in Handler

- Set up a new account at **https://ethereal.email**
- Code functionality
  - `const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({...})`
  - `const info = await transporter.sendMail({` _(within handler)_
- For the **return** component, can use `JSON.stringify(info)` to inspect results
- View mail at **Ethereal --> Messages**
- **NOTE:** Besides swapping out credentials, there is **no difference** between Ethereal and a transactional email service
